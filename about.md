Paimbnails transforms Geometry Dash into a <cl>fully visual experience</c>. Thumbnails, effects, audio, emotes, pets, profiles and more. All seamlessly integrated into the game you already love.

\---

## Thumbnails

<cb>**Level Thumbnails**</c> appear on every level cell: in search results, lists, gauntlets, map packs, daily/weekly/event and official levels. Profile pages also get their own <cb>thumbnail visuals</c>. Browse all thumbnails for a level in the <cb>**Thumbnail Gallery**</c> or capture your own using the <co>**In-Game Capture**</c> system with full scene detection and the <co>**Layer Editor**</c> to compose the perfect shot. Thumbnails support <cb>PNG, GIF, WebP and MP4 video</c>.

## Visual Effects

<cp>**17 background styles**</c> for the level info screen: Pixel, Blur, Grayscale, Sepia, Vignette, Scanlines, Bloom, Chromatic, Radial Blur, Glitch, Posterize, Rain, Matrix, Neon Pulse, Wave Distortion, CRT and Normal. <cp>**Stack up to 4 effects**</c> for unique combos. Over <cp>**20 hover effects**</c> on level cells: brightness, darken, sepia, gold, rainbow, invert, pixelate and more. Plus <cp>animated gradients</c>, <cp>mythic particles</c> and <cp>configurable hover animations</c>.

## Paimon RTX

<co>**Real-time screen-space ray tracing**</c> over the whole game. Paimbnails reads the finished frame, derives a surface from it (relief from contrast, normals from its derivatives, emitters from brightness) and marches rays across it for <co>bounced light tinted by whatever reflects it</c>, <co>contact occlusion</c> and <co>screen-space reflections</c>. On top of that: multi-level <co>bloom</c>, <co>volumetric light shafts</c>, four <co>tonemapping curves</c> (ACES, Filmic, Uncharted 2, Reinhard), color grading and lens effects. Built to stay cheap: tracing runs at <co>20-100% of screen resolution</c> with <co>adaptive quality</c>, frame skipping, temporal accumulation and four presets. <co>51 controls</c> in <co>Extras > Paimon RTX</c>.

## Frame Interpolation

Geometry Dash simulates at <cj>240 fixed ticks per second</c> and draws whenever the display refreshes, so every frame shows a state that has been standing still for anywhere between zero and a full tick. That leftover changes frame to frame, and it is what you see as <cj>micro-stutter</c> at 144, 165 or 240 Hz. Paimbnails keeps the last two ticks and draws the in-between state the real clock asks for, so motion advances by the same amount every frame. <cj>Camera</c>, <cj>background and ground</c>, <cj>both players</c> and, optionally, <cj>trigger-driven objects</c> each get their own switch, with three <cj>latency modes</c> and a strength dial. The simulation is never touched: the authoritative values are restored the moment the frame is drawn, so physics, replays and percentages come out identical.

## Custom Transitions

Over <cg>**30 screen transitions**</c>: fades, slides, flips, zooms, page curls, tile effects, radial wipes and more. Set a <cg>separate transition for entering levels</c> or create <cg>custom scripted sequences</c> combining fade, move, scale, and rotate.

## Custom Progress Bar

<cg>**Full control**</c> over the in-game progress bar: move, scale, rotate, or set <cg>vertical orientation</c>. Pick <cg>custom colors</c> with solid, pulse, or rainbow animation modes for the fill, background and percentage label. Swap in your own <cg>textures</c> (PNG, JPG, WebP or GIF) and add <cg>free-floating decorations</c>. The percentage font, position and offset are fully configurable too. Enable <cg>free drag</c> from the pause menu or enter the <cg>edit overlay</c> to fine-tune everything live.

## Mod Previews

When you open a Geode mod, Paimbnails shows <cb>**preview images**</c> for any mod whose repository includes a <cb>`previews`</c> folder. Click a thumbnail for a <cb>full-screen gallery</c>. Inspired by <cb>Alphalaneous</c>.

## Audio

<cy>**Dynamic Song**</c> plays the level's song while browsing. <cy>**Stream Undownloaded Songs**</c> to preview them before downloading. <cy>**Profile Music**</c> lets users set a custom song fragment on their profile with waveform visualization and crossfade. All audio sources coordinate automatically, <cy>no conflicts, smooth transitions</c>. The leaderboard features <cy>real-time beat detection</c> with FFT spectrum analysis powering reactive visuals.

## Emotes

A full <cj>**emote system**</c> for comments and text inputs. Pick emotes from the <cj>built-in picker</c>, use <cj>autocomplete</c> as you type, and see them <cj>rendered inline</c> in supported views.

## Pet System

Adopt <co>**custom pets**</c> from the Pet Shop and watch them follow you across menus. Manage your collection in the <co>**Pet Gallery**</c>, choose which screens they appear on and enjoy auto-cleanup for corrupted files.

## Profile Features

<cl>**Rate profiles**</c> with 1–5 stars and a message. View all <cl>profile reviews</c> directly from the profile page. VIP users, Moderators, and Admins can set <cl>animated GIFs</c> as their profile picture.

## Profile Levels

Every profile gets an <cy>**XP level, a tier and badges**</c> derived from its public stats. Stars, moons, diamonds, coins and creator points all pay XP, and <cy>demons pay by difficulty</c> from easy to extreme. <cy>**200 levels across 20 tiers**</c>, <cy>**124 badges**</c> in twelve categories, an animated breakdown of where your XP comes from, and a card that slides in with the gain every time you beat a level.

## Custom Backgrounds

Customize the background for <cg>CreatorLayer</c>, <cg>LevelBrowserLayer</c>, <cg>LevelSearchLayer</c> and <cg>LeaderboardsLayer</c> individually. Options include Custom Image, Random Thumbnail, Level ID, same as Menu or GD Default, each with <cg>dark mode and intensity controls</c>.

## Level Cell Settings

One popup to configure everything: <cy>background type, thumbnail size, blur, darkness, separator, view button, compact mode, hover animations, mythic particles and animated gradients</c>. All changes <cy>apply instantly</c>.

## Moderation

<cr>**Verification Center**</c> for reviewing thumbnails, updates, reports, banners and profile images. <cr>**Ban system**</c> with reasons. <cr>**Moderator management**</c>. <cr>**Report system**</c> for inappropriate content. <cr>Admin and Moderator badges</c> on comments and profiles.

## Performance

<cg>Multi-layer caching</c> (RAM + disk) with LRU eviction and manifest persistence. <cg>Priority-based loading</c>, visible cells first, prefetch in background. <cg>Batched GPU uploads</c> to prevent stuttering. <cg>Request deduplication</c> and <cg>exponential backoff</c> on failures. CDN-accelerated downloads via batch manifest lookups.

## Inspirations & Third-Party Credits

Some Paimbnails features were inspired by ideas from other creators. Each one below is an <cb>independent implementation written from scratch</c> — no code was copied — but the idea deserves credit. There is one stated exception: <cb>Search History</c>, which ports logic from the MIT-licensed original (see below and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). <cb>Separate Dual Icons</c> was also audited against its unlicensed original and rewritten from its behavior spec the same day; see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md. Paimbnails also interoperates with third-party services and mods, credited at the end of the list.

* <cb>Mod Previews</c>: inspired by <cb>Alphalaneous</c>. Preview images belong to each mod's own repository authors and are only displayed, never redistributed.
* <cb>Message Notifications</c>: inspired by <cb>BlueToadMaker</c>. It queries RobTop's own public endpoints, the same ones the game client uses.
* <cb>Search History</c>: based on <cb>Search History</c> by <cb>hiimjasmine00</c> (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2024-2026 hiimjasmine00), with Paimbnails UI and persistence.
* <cb>Separate Dual Icons</c>: inspired by <cb>Weebify</c>. Independently rewritten from the behavior spec (2026-09-20); see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.
* <cb>Custom Cursor</c> (click-state tracking): inspired by <cb>Ecuet</c>. The cursor shop browses <cb>rw-designer.com</c> and <cb>custom-cursor.com</c>: every artwork belongs to those sites and their authors, listings link back to the original pages, and files download only when you explicitly install them.
* <cb>Texture Studio</c> recoloring idea inspired by <cb>PackGen</c> by <cb>Asterveila</c>, building on <cb>ravexcode</c>'s TexturePackWeb. Independent implementation, fully self-contained: no external downloads or mirror. See THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md for details.

If you are one of these authors and want the wording changed, open an issue or reach out on Discord and it will be fixed.
